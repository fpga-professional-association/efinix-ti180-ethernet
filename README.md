## Performance profile (this fork)

Measured on hardware (PC -> FPGA sustained TCP, gigabit LAN): **367 Mbit/s**
(vendor baseline 260 at 200 MHz; Efinix's published figure 298). Changes:
SoC 250 MHz (PLL div 5->4), lwIP PBUF_POOL_BUFSIZE 1536, MEM_SIZE 64K,
CHECKSUM_GEN_UDP=1 (also fixes DHCP - routers may drop checksum-0 DISCOVERs).

**Timing caveat:** at 250 MHz this design's io_systemClk closes to Fmax
~235 MHz (-0.25 ns setup, seed 3 / effort 2; a seed-7 / effort-3 run was
worse at 227). The shipped configuration is therefore a mild overclock that
runs clean on the bench at room temperature (verified: 8 consecutive 4 s
transfers plus a 20 s sustained run at ~355 Mbit/s, zero TCP aborts). For
guaranteed-by-STA operation, set the io_systemClk out_divider back to 5
(200 MHz) in the peri.xml - the lwIP tuning alone is still worth ~10-15%.

**Why not faster?** The link is 1000BASE-T full duplex (RTL8211FD-CG PHY on
the daughter card, rated 10/100/1000), so the wire ceiling is ~941 Mbit/s TCP
goodput. The gap is CPU-bound, not cache- or DMA-bound: at ~355 Mbit/s the
board processes ~30k frames/s, i.e. the entire per-frame budget of the
250 MHz RISC-V is ~8,000 cycles for interrupt entry, cache maintenance,
lwIP tcp_input, and ACK generation. An experimental firmware that batched
RX processing and replaced the per-frame `data_cache_invalidate_all()` with
one flush per burst measured *no* throughput gain (and was less stable), so
cache maintenance is not the bottleneck - the plateau is lwIP protocol
processing itself. Meaningful further gains would need TCP offload in
fabric or a hard-wired checksum/segmentation path, not firmware tuning.
