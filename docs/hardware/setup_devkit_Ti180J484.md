## Steps for connecting the hardware to Ti180J484 Development Board. 

1. Hardware connection for RTC DS3231: (Required a MIPI daughter expansion card to be attached on P2 )
* Connect SCL of the DS3231 to pin32 (P2)
* Connect SDA of the DS3231 to pin34 (P2)
* Connect GND of the DS3231 to pin5 (P2)
* Connect VCC of the DS3231 to pin1 (P2)

2. Hardware connection for Micro SD Card:
* Simply attach micro sd card to the on-board micro SD slot of Ti180J484. 

3. Hardware connection for Ethernet:
* Attach FMC-to-QSE Adaptor to the J5 of the Ti180J484.
* Attach Ethernet Connector Daughter card to J2 of the FMC-to-QSE Adaptor.
* Connect ethernet cable from Ethernet Connector Daughter card to the computer.
* Make sure the connected ethernet cable is CAT 5E. 

4. Hardware Connection for Vision:
* Connect the Raspberry Pi v2 camera module to the daughter card using the 15-pin flat cable.
* Attach the Dual Raspberry Pi Camera Connector Daughter Card to the P1 connector of the Titanium Ti180J484 Development Board.
* Attach the HDMI Connector Daughter Card to the J1 connector of the FMC to QSE Adaptor. 
* Connect HDMI Cable to the HDMI Connector Daughter Card.

5. Ensure all boards have the followings jumper settings:
